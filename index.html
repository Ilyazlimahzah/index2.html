        My name is Agbaje Fawaz Omogbolahan, a student of AltSchool Africa,
        backend track with student ID number “ALT/SOE/023/3699”. I’m Nigerian,
        born June the 7th. I’m a final year student of the University of Ilorin,
        Electrical and Electronics department.

        I’m a writer. Well, writer by hobby and not profession. Not anymore at
        least. I mostly do poetry, which is why I say it’s more of a hobby. If
        you ask me though, I could tell you a million different reasons why I
        write and none of them would be “because it’s my hobby” or “because I
        enjoy it”. Anyways, I think of myself more of a poet than a writer. It’s
        as I say, “every poet is a writer but not every writer is a poet”.
        Writing stories and whatnot is one thing, poetry on the other hand comes
        from somewhere different. One could write stories to entertain
        regardless of the veracity of what’s in the writing, it could be
        informing, educative, it could be a number of things depending on what
        the writer is going for. Which is why this could easily be a profession.
        It comes with returns. Poetry only speaks to a certain audience, and one
        can either resonate with it or not. It’s as simple as that.

        I’m a part time photographer and videographer as well. That, I only just
        became fond of recently. It’s been months now, and nothing
        short of amazing. I can tell it’s going to be a long-term deal. I would
        say photography summarizes my love for art in general in a canvas; makes
        it still. Capturing moments, reliving captured moments. Aubrey Drake
        once said, “some nights I wish I could go back in time, not to change
        shit but to feel a couple things twice”. Read that again. How best do
        you feel things all over again if not through memories which could
        easily be pictures and videos. You could be basking in just as much
        euphoria reliving the day, this time, with no interference from the
        universe itself. It plays out just how you remember it. Just how you
        remember it. Rest in that. 
        <p>

            I work for the company “theInfoNerds”. I’ve
            since come to learn a lot, met good people, made alliances that have
            been awesome thus far. It goes without saying the job takes me around,
            different locations of course which is thrilling because I do enjoy
            exploring new sceneries. The experience in general has been fantastic.

        I also play basketball and I work out. Notice how these came last? Well,
        I’ll also be saying the least about them because they very much speak
        for themselves. Maybe not the first as much as the latter, I mean you
        can’t tell I play basketball by just looking at me, right? But yes, I
        ball and a workout, a lot.

      My tech journey has been a really rough and bumpy ride. Before AltSchool,
      I’ve delved into a number of different parts in tech in general. Web dev,
      UI/UX, well, just those two actually. But they were ages apart and each
      was a sad story on its own, figuratively. My ordeal and the little to no
      knowledge in the years I tried my hands on these are invariably to why
      I was never a fan of anything tech for a long time. Until recently, I
      found the courage to cast my net into the ocean again, see how many a fish
      I’ll catch.
      <p>

          I’m elated about the progress I’ve made so far in AltSchool
          and it’s for sure different from the other times I’ve tried to take
          classes from ‘institutions’.I'm more enthusiatic this time and for some
          reason, I just want to know everything. That is pretty much it, really.
          Ofcourse, I know that's not practicable, nevertheless,there is no reason
          why I can't be a maestro in as many domains. And that is what i want from
          Altschoolafrica. I believe i can be equipped with everything that would be
          instrumental to giving me the foundation necessary to achieve that.
